# Setup

Declarative Gradle [samples](./samples.md) require nightly versions of Gradle and Android Studio.
They all use the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to point to the right Gradle version, so you don't have to worry about installing a specific version of Gradle.

To try out the samples and see all of the features, you need to install a few other components as described below:

- [JDK](#jdk)
- [IDE](#ide)
  - [Android Studio](#android-studio)
  - [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code)
  - [Eclipse IDE](#eclipse-ide)
- [Gradle Client](#gradle-client)
- [Pick a sample](#pick-a-sample)

## JDK

Make sure to use a JDK >= 17 and that your `JAVA_HOME` points to it.

You can use a JDK from any vendor.
We recommend [Eclipse Temurinâ„¢ (OpenJDK)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

## IDE

### Android Studio

Download and install a special Android Studio Nightly release.
You can find the promoted nightly releases in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19C5EMRgENKU_tOAwOVLcIGZ6Bbm63Q7V) for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows and Linux.
Pick the most recent one that matches your operating system.

Declarative features are only available on particular nightly releases.

!!! warn
    Note that these nightly builds are not signed/notarized and will require you to accept running them anyway.
    Also note that on macOS, these special Android Studio releases require to be in `~/Applications`.

#### Enable more declarative features in Studio

While syntax highlighting of `.gradle.dcl` files works out of the box in Studio nightlies, other features require flags to be enabled.

1. Open _Tools_ -> _Internal Actions_ -> _Registry_
1. Search for the Declarative Gradle flags by typing `declarative`
2. Enable the `gradle.declarative.studio.support` and `gradle.declarative.ide.support` flags
3. Restart the IDE

### Visual Studio Code

Download the [Declarative Gradle VSIX](https://gradle.github.io/declarative-vscode-extension/) and install it in your Visual Studio Code.

This extension was also tested in GitHub Codespace and should work in any Visual Studio Code derivative.

### Eclipse IDE

Install the Declarative Gradle editor support for the Eclipse IDE from Buildship snapshot [Update Site](https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/user/DeclarativeGradle.md) in our Eclipse IDE.

Make sure to follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/eclipse/buildship/blob/master/docs/user/DeclarativeGradle.md#setup) as more steps are needed for this to work.

## Gradle Client

The _Gradle Client_ is a standalone application used to demonstrate declarative features not yet implemented in the IDE.

Download the latest release from the [Gradle Client](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-client/releases/latest) repository on GitHub and install it.

The `DMG` file is for macOS, the `DEB` file is for Linux and the `MSI` file is for Windows.

!!! warn
    Note that the _Gradle Client_ is not signed/notarized and will require you to accept running it anyway.

## Pick a sample

After you've installed everything, pick out a [samples](./samples.md) to try the Declarative Gradle features.
