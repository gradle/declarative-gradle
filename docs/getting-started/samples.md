# Samples
!!! tip
    Make sure you followed the [setup](./setup.md) instructions fully before trying out a sample.

All samples in this page can be used to demonstrate features made possible by Declarative Gradle.

- [Java Application](#java-application)
- [Kotlin Application](#kotlin-application)
- [Android Application](#android-application)
- [Now In Android](#now-in-android)
- [Bleeding edge prototypes](#bleeding-edge-prototypes)

After picking a sample, read about new [Declarative Gradle features](./features.md).

## Java Application

A sample Java application written in the Declarative Gradle DSL, using the prototype Declarative Gradle `javaApplication` Software Type defined in the `org.gradle.experimental.jvm-ecosystem` ecosystem plugin.

Please follow the README available at [github.com/gradle/declarative-samples-java-app](https://github.com/gradle/declarative-samples-java-app) to try this sample.

## Kotlin Application

A sample Kotlin application written in the Declarative Gradle DSL, using the prototype Declarative Gradle `kotlinJvmApplication` Software Type defined in the `org.gradle.experimental.kmp-ecosystem` ecosystem plugin.

Please follow the README available at  [github.com/gradle/declarative-samples-kotlin-app](https://github.com/gradle/declarative-samples-kotlin-app) to try this sample.

## Android Application

A sample Android application written in the Declarative Gradle DSL, using the prototype Declarative Gradle `androidApplication` Software Type defined in the `org.gradle.experimental.android-ecosystem` ecosystem plugin.

Please follow the README available at  [github.com/gradle/declarative-samples-android-app](https://github.com/gradle/declarative-samples-android-app) to try this sample.

## Now In Android

[Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) is a fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose from the Android team.
We forked _Now in Android_ and updated the build to work with Declarative Gradle.
The prototype repository can be found in [github.com/gradle/nowinandroid](https://github.com/gradle/nowinandroid).

Please follow the README available at [github.com/gradle/nowinandroid/DECLARATIVE-README.md](https://github.com/gradle/nowinandroid/blob/main-declarative/DECLARATIVE-README.md) to try this sample.

## Bleeding edge prototypes

If you want to go further you can take a look at some more projects for JVM, Android, KMP, Swift and C++ projects. These projects may use newer versions of Gradle or require additional manual setup, so you should try the other samples first. 

They are available at [github.com/gradle/declarative-gradle/tree/main/unified-prototype](https://github.com/gradle/declarative-gradle/tree/main/unified-prototype).

Please follow the README available in each directory linked below to try these samples.
