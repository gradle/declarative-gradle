# Declarative Gradle - Share Feedback

While Declarative Gradle is in early stages, you can explore the project samples and some of the features.
Check out the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/README.md) tfor the pointer.
Initial feedback on the DSL, early demos, features and use-cases will be appreciated!

## Slack

We have a `#declarative-gradle` channel on the [Gradle Community Slack](https://community.gradle.org/contributing/community-slack/).
It is a main discussion channel for the feature and for Q&A.

If you are a Kotlin user, there is also a `#gradle` channel on the [Kotlin Foundation Slack](https://community.gradle.org/contributing/community-slack/).

## GitHub Issues

For any bug report or feature request,
feel free to use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gradle/declarative-gradle/issues) in our dedicated Declarative Gradle repository.
Later, we may move them into the main Gradle repository.
